# Behavior

## Modification and Refactoring
- **Do not modify** an existing function or class unless explicitly requested.
- Refactoring should only be performed if specifically asked for.

## Checking for Existing Implementations
- Always verify if a **type** or **function** already exists before attempting to implement it.
- Never duplicate functionality that is already available.

## Service Utilization
- Always check existing **services** before implementing a new function.
- Determine the most appropriate location within the architecture to add new functionality.

## Solution Proposal and Validation
- Always **propose a solution** with a detailed explanation before implementing it.
- Request explicit validation before applying any changes.
